Now it gets baked under an aggressively thick layer of streusel.",

      "description": "To make this happen you’re going to have two main spots you’re working on (and I use the term “working on” very loosely):\n.\n1-Your pasta pot (boil spaghetti / mix with sauce)\n2-Your sheet pan (toss zucchini with panko and spices, bake until yummy)\n.\nAnd with minimal effort, look at what you’re eating for dinner: a hot, twirly bowl of spaghetti loaded high with cheesy zucchini crispities and fresh basil. Add some extra lemon juice or red pepper flakes to wake it all up and this is not a sad dinner situation.",
